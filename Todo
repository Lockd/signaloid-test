Build a single-page web application that allows users to run some tasks in a cloud-like environment.
This platform should have three basic functionalities:

- Allow users to start running a new task.
- Simulate the running task.
- Allow users to view their task history.

1. Allow users to start running a new task.
   A user should provide two inputs to be able to start running a task:
   1.1 Name of the task
   1.2 Compute VM options (these options will be provided by us)

- VM-S (representing a small instance virtual machine)
- VM-M (representing a medium instance virtual machine)
- VM-L (representing a large instance virtual machine)
  After the inputs are provided as requested, the user can start running the task.

2. Simulate the running task.
   You need to simulate tasks running in the background.
   Give feedback that the user task is running.
   This simulation will go over 3 phases:

- Starting: random timeout between 1-2 seconds.
- Running: random timeout based on what the user chose as a Compute VM option:
- VM-S: between 3 and 4 seconds
- VM-M: between 2 and 3 seconds
- VM-L: between 1 and 2 seconds
- Completed

3. Allow users to view their task history.

- A user should be able to view their task history.
- The task history should be persistent in local storage.
- Previous (historic) tasks should contain metadata related to the task run. ex: execution time

Bonus points:

- Users should be able to observe live status updates while a task is executing. This UI component should update the status, while the task is mid-execution (not 'Completed')
- Provide a 'Cancel' option for tasks mid-execution (not 'Completed'). This functionality will introduce a new 'Canceled' task state.
- Task history can be searched/filtered.

Our expectations:

- Spend no more than half a working day (~4h) on this assessment and complete as much of the basic functionality that you can.
- Add simple documentation, e.g., a Readme.md.
- Delivery of the project within seven days of receiving the assessment (28/09/2023).
- There is no expectation about completion of bonus points and you are free to invest as much time as you want on them.

Our suggestions:

- Opt for an aesthetically pleasing UI.
- Take no more than one bonus point if you choose to do so.
- Reach out if you have any questions
